			Open up the notepad No time for the chitchat
			<br />
			Wonder when I wrote that It's lyrical combat
			<br />
			Another diss track To prove that I am bad
			<br />
			Another big brag Bout the size of my weed sack I
			<br />
			<br />
			Been feeling blocked up so I take cheap shots
			<br />
			Liquor in the cup, write down sick thoughts
			<br />
			Climbing up the totem, make it to the top spot
			<br />
			But I'm tired of pretending that I'm something I'm not
			<br />
			<br />
			Fake brags, fake flow, fake beat
			<br />
			Fake face, fake smile, fake me
			<br />
			Fake the lingo, it's fire lowkey
			<br />
			I'm a fraud so I sell it for free
			<br />
			<br />
			I'm comprised of a cheap disguise <br />
			I'll tell the truth when I next revise <br />
			But for now let's just say I am streetwise <br />
			Running out of lead so I incise my lies
			<br />
			<br /> Carved into the desk while I squirm in the chair
			<br /> Push meds on the kid, he’ll sit still, I swear
			<br /> Sell em to the cool kids and learn how to share
			<br /> Get everyone spun out more than ric flair
			<br />
			<br /> Grind teeth til they’re just not there
			<br /> Couple in the bottle, not enough to spare
			<br /> Now the cool kids are gone and I’m still just a square
			<br />
			Yet I’m fiendish for another way to feel impaired
			<br />
			<br /> Once I come down, I’ll finally come up
			<br /> Make a lot of money but it’s still not enough
			<br /> I should feel blessed, it coul be more rough
			<br /> I’d kick your ass but I’m not really tough
			<br />
			<br /> Press harder on the pen, put the words in the granite
			<br /> Don’t just spit but spit more candid
			<br /> Pick apart til the words are dismantled
			<br /> Put it back together once your mind is expanded
			<br />
			<br /> Not trying to get high, just trying to stay level
			<br /> When Im most gone is when my mind’s most settled
			<br />
			Everywhere I go, I keep a pocketful of petals
			<br /> You think I’m fucked up, my mom thinks I’m special
			<br />
			<br /> Imposter impossibly posting up, I'm unstoppable
			<br /> narcotics and neurosis is in my cup, narcotics optional
			<br />
			Instantly incinerate the enemy, unprobable
			<br />
			Hypnotize them with another lie until I’m popular
			<br />
			<br /> Take pause, can I have your attention
			<br />
			Bottoms up, let’s prepare for ascension <br />I act up so I’m stuck
			in detention <br />
			But spend more time in another dimension
			<br />
			<br /> Blast off and now I feel like myself
			<br /> Don’t really care about anybody else <br />
			Trade for peace of mind with brain cells
			<br /> Anything to get me out of this shell
