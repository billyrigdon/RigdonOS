		Feeling low let me hide in the music<br />
		I’ve got a brain so I might as well
		use it <br />It seems like a good mood is just so elusive<br /> But in the grand
		scheme, life’s just an illusion<br /><br /> Trying to focus my mind on the present<br />
		Trying to find myself in His presence<br /> Letting go, I accept the deception<br />
		Pull myself out of the crevice<br /><br /> Bootstraps broke, I was pulling too hard<br />
		I found the edge, I was pushed too far<br /> I’m getting better but I’m just
		so jarred <br />Demons snuck up and caught me off my guard <br /><br />My lungs are
		collapsing, I’m gasping for air<br /> My mind is relaxing and blasting my
		cares<br /> Life has been taxing and grasping my share<br /> Now I’m just laughing
		with the clashing of snares<br /><br /> Where’d it happen, it happened right there<br />
		There was slashing, assassins were scared<br /> The scars are attracting the
		casting of glares<br /> But I’ll mask it and pass on the dare<br /><br /> It’s not fair,
		but it doesn’t really matter<br /> Let em stare and ignore all the chatter<br />
		I’ve got sympathy for the hatter<br /> It’s downhill from here I could never
		be madder<br /><br /> I’ve been in hibernation, I’m a beast on the track<br /> Forget the
		pen, I’ll type it up on an app<br /> Too loud, turn it down just a tad<br /> You’re
		messing with the best, montel’s got my back
